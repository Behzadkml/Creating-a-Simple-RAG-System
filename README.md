# Simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

This is a basic Python implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that retrieves relevant documents from a given corpus and generates text based on the retrieved context. It combines semantic search using FAISS, embeddings via SentenceTransformers, and text generation through Hugging Face Transformers (GPT-2).

## Features
- **Semantic retrieval** using FAISS for efficient similarity search
- **Embeddings** generated by SentenceTransformers
- **Text generation** using GPT-2 from Hugging Face

## Installation
Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install sentence-transformers transformers faiss-cpu
```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your documents** in a Python list:

```python
documents = [
    "Python is a programming language created by Guido van Rossum.",
    "Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques.",
    "The capital city of France is Paris.",
    "TensorFlow and PyTorch are popular machine learning frameworks.",
    "FAISS is a library for efficient similarity search."
]
```

2. **Run the retrieval and generation**:

```python
from rag_system import rag

query = "What are popular machine learning frameworks?"
response = rag(query)

print(response)
```

## How It Works
- **Retrieval**: Converts documents and queries into semantic vectors using SentenceTransformers and retrieves similar documents using FAISS.
- **Generation**: Uses GPT-2 to generate answers based on the retrieved documents, ensuring more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## Example Output
```
Context: TensorFlow and PyTorch are popular machine learning frameworks. Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques.

Question: What are popular machine learning frameworks?
Answer: Popular machine learning frameworks include TensorFlow and PyTorch.
```

## Customization
- Add or modify documents in your corpus.
- Change retrieval parameters (e.g., `top_k` documents).
- Experiment with different Hugging Face models for text generation.
